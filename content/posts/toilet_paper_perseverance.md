Getting started with a new roll of toilet paper can be a pretty frustrating experience.

The first sheet is stuck down with some sort of adhesive that seems to designed to be just sticky enough to be annoying. At first you try the delicate approach, you try to preserve that first sheet, but that doesn’t last long. 

They sometimes don't even give you a little strip of loose paper that you can tug on to get things going. If this happens you're left with no option but to start ripping at the thing from the side. 

In spite of your best efforts you will likely rip the first few sheets in two. Or if you're lucky enough to have multiple ply paper you might be unlucky enough to find those plys separating as you negotiate the first few luxurious sheets. 

Either way you've got to fiddle around with the first sheet for a while. It's annoying, and can go badly, but it has to be done.

Once you're past the first sheet things start to move a bit more smoothly. The third or fourth sheet is often stuck down too, but at this point you've got a bit of leverage, a trickle of momentum, so it comes up easier than the first.

Get by those first few problematic sheets and you're really on your way. The rest of the roll comes flying off the tubular skeleton it’s wrapped around.

You keep pulling and it keeps coming, usually with little or no resistance.

## Why am I talking about toilet paper?

The next time you're starting a project of some description I want you to think about toilet paper. 

It doesn't matter what the project is, it might be a new health and fitness routine, some sort of DIY job or a new initiative in work. Whatever it is, think about toilet paper and remember that no matter what it is you are doing there's always a tricky, annoying and tedious bit at the beginning. But once you get past that bit, once you gain a little momentum, everything starts to come easier.

Don't give up at the first sheet... Keep on pulling until the roll is spinning.
